# That's me

Since ever I am curious how things work. This is especially true for physics, chemistry and electronics and information technology.
When I try to understand stuff I often do recreate it to get an idea why things were designed as they are and how they work or impact technology.

I also like puzzling around and build things. So this is my playground for a lot of different things, to learn and play around.
